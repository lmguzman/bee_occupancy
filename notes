From bee group: 

What visits can be used?

10-15 super common genera per ecoregion
we need at least x, y z 
Lassioglosum and Agapostemom

Who is occupying each land-fire type/ecoregion
smaller areas seeing species-areas relationships
Are you started to see a plateau of what species are being detected in samples - rarefaction analysis

Visit intervals - frame for other bees 
- visit period a year 
- visit periods for quarters

Percentage loss and have a minimum to start with 

Specialist 
species that are hard to identify <- mostly on the losing list 

cup vs net sampling?
- cup and sampling events have changed through time - 

collection method - changed through time. 

Antophora - most of specimens in the US - neglecta and dioniside could be declining
abronia-- timberlake and other people looks specifically -- imposible bias to overcome
range size -- 



### notes Leithen

- Try running the environmental model with more memory (genus inferences)

- Species specific slopes may not be good, family specific slopes, or genus specific slopes for environmental predictors

- scale all of the variables (done)

- run for longer to help with convergence 

- check how many zeros we are adding through time

- how much does the era term shrink when we include the era term in the env model? -- as a proxy for can we explain this era effect with something else

---- 

- focus on the magnitudes of these effects -- is the decline real?
- actual trends in the records -- increasing number of records 
- run the model 
- how many zeros are we adding??
- what sorts of patterns in the data could cause that effect. Are these patterns spurious things or indicative of a real change in bee occupancy? 
- rare vs common bees?
- add area?
- species level effects and plot family trajectories even in a model that doesnt have family in the model



-------
shuffle occupancy site labels -- all of the predictors have the same structure but the occupancy 
- none of them should be significant

Check the pesticide in nevada, west
why it looks like there is no relationship between pesticide aplication and agriculture

check the agriculture at the county level



-------

Use interception to figure out how much pesticide per county per site

### area of itercection of each county with that site --
### calculate the pesticide -- area of intercetion of the county divided by area of county multiplied by pesticide


Weight each pesticide by dividing by the LD50

For each site sum the amount of pesticide 

then we add the different types of pesticides

then log
