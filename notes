From bee group: 

What visits can be used?

10-15 super common genera per ecoregion
we need at least x, y z 
Lassioglosum and Agapostemom

Who is occupying each land-fire type/ecoregion
smaller areas seeing species-areas relationships
Are you started to see a plateau of what species are being detected in samples - rarefaction analysis

Visit intervals - frame for other bees 
- visit period a year 
- visit periods for quarters

Percentage loss and have a minimum to start with 

Specialist 
species that are hard to identify <- mostly on the losing list 

cup vs net sampling?
- cup and sampling events have changed through time - 

collection method - changed through time. 

Antophora - most of specimens in the US - neglecta and dioniside could be declining
abronia-- timberlake and other people looks specifically -- imposible bias to overcome
range size -- 



### notes Leithen

- Try running the environmental model with more memory (genus inferences)

- Species specific slopes may not be good, family specific slopes, or genus specific slopes for environmental predictors

- scale all of the variables

- run for longer to help with convergence 

- check how many zeros we are adding through time

- how much does the era term shrink when we include the era term in the env model? -- as a proxy for can we explain this era effect with something else

---- 

- focus on the magnitudes of these effects -- is the decline real?
- actual trends in the records -- increasing number of records 
- run the model 
- how many zeros are we adding??
- what sorts of patterns in the data could cause that effect. Are these patterns spurious things or indicative of a real change in bee occupancy? 
- rare vs common bees?
- add area?
- species level effects and plot family trajectories even in a model that doesnt have family in the model
